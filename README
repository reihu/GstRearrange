This GStreamer plugin takes a stereo signal and puts it into two specified
channels of a multichannel audio stream. The other channels will remain
silent.

You can use this plugin to send multiple stereo streams to a surround sound
card (when you use it in combination with the adder plugin).

Usage example:
  $ gst-launch -v -m audiotestsrc ! rearrange channels=4 pos=1 ! alsasink
    Sends a sine wave to the rear channels of a four-channel alsa stream

Properties:
- channels: Specifies the output channel count.
  This can be an integer in the range of 2..8
- pos: Specifies the output channels where the plugin should put the original
  input signal. It accepts the following values:
  0: front channels
  1: rear channels
  2: center/lfe
  3: side channels

If _channels_ < 2*(pos+1), the output signal will be silent (you can use
this to generate a multichannel silence if you need it)

Build this plugin like this:

    ./autogen.sh
    make

Once the plugin is built you can either install it with 'sudo make install'
(however, this will by default go into the /usr/local prefix where it won't
be picked up by a GStreamer installed from packages, so you would need to
set the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to include or point to
/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-0.10/ for your plugin to be found by a from-package
GStreamer). Alternatively, you will find your plugin binary in
gst-plugins/src/.libs/ as libgstplugin.so or similar (the extension may vary),
so you can also set the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environmen variable to the
gst-plugins/src/.libs/ directory (best to specify an absolute path though).

You can also check if it has been built correctly with:

    gst-inspect-0.10 gst-plugins/src/.libs/libgstplugin.so

This Plugin was built upon the generic GStreamer plugin template found at [4].
